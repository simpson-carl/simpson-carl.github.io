```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(htmlwidgets)
library(sparkline)
set.seed(1234)
x = cumsum(rnorm(500))
y = cumsum(rnorm(500))
```


Sparklines are word sized graphics. `r sparkline(x, 
    fillColor = "", 
    lineColor = '#4c4c4c', 
    spotColor ="",
    minSpotColor = "",
    maxSpotColor = "",
    highlightSpotColor = "",
    highlightLineColor = "")` They show time series.
