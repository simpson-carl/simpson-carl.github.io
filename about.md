I'm Carl Simpson, a paleobiologist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. I work on the evolution and macroevolution of colonial marine invertebrates, especially corals and bryozoans. Corals and bryozoans are structured hierarchically, with a mix of important colony- and zooid-level attributes. I am interested in understanding how their evolution is guided by the interactions between selection at the zooid and the colony levels. 

To me, the core job of macroevolution is to understand the interactions between evolutionary processes across hierarchical levels. My work on the evolution of colonies allows me to identify, in detail, how closely linked levels interact. At the other extreme, my work on species selection allows me to understand how mostly decoupled levels interact to produce large-scale trends.
