Marine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by direct and indirect anthropogenic impacts, but knowledge of the underlying extinction vulnerabilities of marine taxa is limited. The fossil record provides rich but underutilized information on past extinctions that can help predict current and future biotic responses. We show that over the past 23 million years, taxonomic membership and geographic range size consistently explain a large proportion of variation in extinction risk among marine genera in six major taxonomic groups. We assess intrinsic risk — the extinction risk predicted by a paleontologically calibrated model — for modern genera in these groups. Mapping the geographic distribution of these genera identifies coastal biogeographic provinces where fauna with high mean intrinsic risk are strongly impacted by human activity or climate change. Such regions are disproportionately located in the tropics, raising the possibility that these biologically diverse ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to future extinctions. Integrating paleontological baselines with modern risk assessments based on detailed but short-term observations will more accurately inform marine management and conservation.
