   *Science Advances*

 
The evolution of modular colonial animals such as reef corals and bryozoans is enigmatic 
because of the ability for modules to proliferate asexually as whole colonies reproduce 
sexually. This reproductive duality creates an evolutionary tension between modules and 
colonies because selection operates at both levels. To understand how this evolutionary
conflict is resolved, we compared the evolutionary potential of module- and colony-level
traits in two species of the bryozoan Stylopoma, grown and bred in a common garden
experiment. We find quantitatively distinct differences in the evolutionary potential
of modular and colony traits. Contrary to solitary organisms, individual traits are
not heritable from mother to daughter modules, but colony traits are strongly heritable
from parent to offspring colonies. Colony-level evolution therefore dominates because 
no evolutionary change can accumulate among its modules.
