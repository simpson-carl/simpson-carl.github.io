My main motivation to host this site on github is to share code for macroevolutionary studies. 
I'll be posting code for using the Price equation for macroevolutionary studies. There will be fossil and phylogenetic versions. I'll add some useful R functions for plotting geological timescales, and some of my utility functions for processing data from the Paleobiology Database.
