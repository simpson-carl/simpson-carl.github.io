SÃ¡nchez, J. A., Lasker, H. R., Zeng, W., Coluci, V. & **Simpson, C.** 2003 How similar are branching networks in nature? A view from the ocean: Caribbean gorgonian corals. *Journal of Theoretical Biology* 222, 135-138. [pdf]({{ site.url }}/papers/J Theor Biol 2003 Sanchez.pdf)

Tree-like branching networks are omnipresent in nature (eg Turcotte et al., 1998). Despite the ubiquity of this pattern across both species and levels of organization, in most cases we do not know how branching patterns evolve or even how they form.
