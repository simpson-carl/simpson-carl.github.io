Bryozoans are colonial animals that grow by budding modules termed zooids, each of which is homologous with a single solitary animal such as an ant or snail (McKinney and Jackson 1991; Ryland 1970). Colonies are tessellated by generic feeding zooids termed autozooids. Scattered among the autozooids are polymorphic zooids that are commonly discrete in shape and function. Autozooids feed by protrusion of a tentacular polypide animal through the orifice of the zooid that is protected by a hinged flap called an operculum. Autozooids can also produce gametes as well as perform all of the tasks to survive, and are considered the evolutionarily primitive condition (Banta 1973; Cheetham 1973; Cheetham et al. 2006; Silén 1977). Polymorphic zooids differ more from each other than even the most extreme members of discrete social insect castes (Wilson 1975). Moreover, the number and frequency of different types of polymorphs can very from colony to colony both within and among species.

The various types of polymorphs differ from autozooids by giving up one or more tasks to specialize on particular functions. Avicularia are the most common polymorphs and come in many forms and sizes, but they all share some basic attributes. Their hinged operculum is modified so that, like a person waving a flag, it can be moved about across the surface of the colony. Avicularia reduce or lose other body parts, such as the polypide with its tentacle crown and major organs, though a vestigial polypide can provide a sensory function within many types of avicularia (Carter et al. 2010). Because avicularia are so reduced, they cannot feed or contribute to reproduction, so they remain connected to other zooids and depend on them for nutrition. The tasks that avicularia perform in the colony include cleaning, defense, and patterning the flow of water across the colony surface (Carter 2008; Winston 1984; Winston 2010), although the specific functions of the various types of avicularia are unknown. Vicarious avicularia are budded with other zooids in the main colony plane, replacing an autozooid without changing the mosaic pattern. Adventitious avicularia are budded atop the plane of the colony where they may overgrow preexisting zooids, adding a second level. Adventitious avicularia are commonly found adjacent to the orifice of autozooids, scattered across their frontal walls, or encrusting other parts of the colony like salt on a pretzel.

There are three other major types of polymorphs—spines, kenozooids and ovicells. Spines, also known as spinozooids (Silén 1977), are zooids that have been reduced into small spiny skeletal protrusions. Each spine is separated from the adjacent autozooid by cuticular tissue (Silén 1977), just as autozooids themselves are separated from each other (Ryland 1970). Kenozooids are diminutive zooids that specialize on filling gaps in the colony’s mosaic where a full autozooid or avicularium would be too large. Although it may seem trivial, filling space is crucial for protection from overgrowth by other organisms that have the potential to get a foothold in empty areas (Jackson 1979; McKinney and Jackson 1991; Palumbi and Jackson 1982). 

Ovicells are dome-shaped polymorphs whose sole function is to brood larvae. Ovicells are budded from the distal end of a parent autozooid, placing the orifice of an ovicell within reach of the parent autozooid polypide tentacle crown. Ovicells vary among species in their position relative to the surface of the colony. In some species they remain submerged below the colony surface within the parental autozooid, but in others the ovicells stand in stark relief above the frontal surfaces of nearby autozooids. Unfertilized eggs or embryos (the site of fertilization is unknown) are passed from the tentacles of the adjacent zooid to the ovicell where they are brooded until ready to disperse (Ostrovsky 2013). Ovicells are uncommon compared to autozooids and are usually one or more orders of magnitude less frequent than autozooids within a colony (Simpson 2012).
