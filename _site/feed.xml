        <title>Paleontological baselines for evaluating extinction risk in the modern oceans</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Seth Finnegan, Sean C. Anderson, Paul G. Harnik, Carl Simpson, Derek P. Tittensor, Jarrett E. Byrnes, Zoe V. Finkel, David R. Lindberg, Lee Hsiang Liow, Rowan Lockwood, Heike K. Lotze, Craig M. McClain, Jenny L. McGuire, Aaron O’Dea, John M. Pandolfi (Accepted) Paleontological baselines for evaluating extinction risk in the modern oceans. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by direct and indirect anthropogenic impacts, but knowledge of the underlying extinction vulnerabilities of marine taxa is limited. The fossil record provides rich but underutilized information on past extinctions that can help predict current and future biotic responses. We show that over the past 23 million years, taxonomic membership and geographic range size consistently explain a large proportion of variation in extinction risk among marine genera in six major taxonomic groups. We assess intrinsic risk — the extinction risk predicted by a paleontologically calibrated model — for modern genera in these groups. Mapping the geographic distribution of these genera identifies coastal biogeographic provinces where fauna with high mean intrinsic risk are strongly impacted by human activity or climate change. Such regions are disproportionately located in the tropics, raising the possibility that these biologically diverse ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to future extinctions. Integrating paleontological baselines with modern risk assessments based on detailed but short-term observations will more accurately inform marine management and conservation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Enriching macroevolution</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Simpson, C. and Erwin, D.H., 2014. Enriching macroevolution. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. 344(6189): 1234-1235. &lt;a href=&quot;/papers/Science 2014 Simpson.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review of &lt;em&gt;Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What drives evolutionary innovation? This question has become a central focus of evolutionary biologists over the past decade as comparative evolutionary developmental biology (“evo-devo”) has established a mechanistic basis for understanding the evolution of form and, increasingly, the evolution of developmental processes themselves. The challenge has been to build a conceptual framework that makes sense of the facts of development and explains how development can evolve while producing viable offspring. Prior to the codification of evo-devo, heterochrony was invoked for this purpose (1). Heterochrony produces new phenotypes by varying the rates of somatic and reproductive maturation, and for a time it was a promising conceptual organizer of develop- mental evolution. But heterochrony can only modify existing allometric variation and thus cannot explain the origin of novel traits—and the history of life is strung with novel traits.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Differential niche dynamics among major marine invertebrate clades</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hopkins, M., Simpson, C., and Kiessling, W., 2014. Differential niche dynamics among major marine invertebrate clades. &lt;em&gt;Ecology Letters&lt;/em&gt;. 17(3):314-323. doi: 10.1111/ele.12232. &lt;a href=&quot;/papers/Ecol Lett 2013 Hopkins.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree to which organisms retain their environmental preferences is of utmost importance in predicting their fate in a world of rapid climate change. Notably, marine invertebrates frequently show strong affinities for either carbonate or terrigenous clastic environments. This affinity is due to characteristics of the sediments as well as correlated environmental factors. We assessed the conservatism of substrate affinities of marine invertebrates over geological timescales, and found that niche conservatism is prevalent in the oceans, and largely determined by the strength of initial habitat preference. There is substantial variation in niche conservatism among major clades with corals and sponges being among the most conservative. Time-series analysis suggests that niche conservatism is enhanced during times of elevated nutrient flux, whereas niche evolution tends to occur after mass extinctions. Niche evolution is not necessarily elevated in genera exhibiting higher turnover in species composition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Simple Method for Estimating Informative Node Age Priors for the Fossil Calibration of Molecular Divergence Time Analyses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowak, M. D., Smith, A. B., Simpson, C., and Zwickl, D. J. 2013. A Simple Method for Estimating Informative Node Age Priors for the Fossil Calibration of Molecular Divergence Time Analyses. &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt; 8(6): e66245. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066245. &lt;a href=&quot;/papers/PloS one 2013 Nowak.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molecular divergence time analyses often rely on the age of fossil lineages to calibrate node age estimates. Most divergence time analyses are now performed in a Bayesian framework, where fossil calibrations are incorporated as parametric prior probabilities on node ages. It is widely accepted that an ideal parameterization of such node age prior probabilities should be based on a comprehensive analysis of the fossil record of the clade of interest, but there is currently no generally applicable approach for calculating such informative priors. We provide here a simple and easily implemented method that employs fossil data to estimate the likely amount of missing history prior to the oldest fossil occurrence of a clade, which can be used to fit an informative parametric prior probability distribution on a node age. Specifically, our method uses the extant diversity and the stratigraphic distribution of fossil lineages confidently assigned to a clade to fit a branching model of lineage diversification. Conditioning this on a simple model of fossil preservation, we estimate the likely amount of missing history prior to the oldest fossil occurrence of a clade. The likelihood surface of missing history can then be translated into a parametric prior probability distribution on the age of the clade of interest. We show that the method performs well with simulated fossil distribution data, but that the likelihood surface of missing history can at times be too complex for the distribution-fitting algorithm employed by our software tool. An empirical example of the application of our method is performed to estimate echinoid node ages. A simulation-based sensitivity analysis using the echinoid data set shows that node age prior distributions estimated under poor preservation rates are significantly less informative than those estimated under high preservation rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/snape.png&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our method provides an estimate for the length of time after age of the MRCA of a clade but prior to the age of the oldest fossil (i.e. the missing history). This hypothetical clade has N = 11 lineages at time T, representing the current standing diversity of the group. Thick bars on the internal branches of the tree represent the preserved fossil history of the clade, such that n = 1 lineage preserved at time t. The expressions for deriving the probability of the three key temporal durations in the history of a clade are shown.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Species selection and the macroevolution of coral photosymbiosis and coloniality</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Simpson, C. 2013. Species selection and the macroevolution of coral photosymbiosis and coloniality. &lt;em&gt;Evolution&lt;/em&gt; 67(6): 1607-1621 &lt;a href=&quot;/papers/Evolution 2013 Simpson.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in the relative diversification rates of species with variant traits are known as species selection. Species selection can produce a macroevolutionary change in the frequencies of traits by changing the relative number of species possessing each trait over time. But species selection is not the only process that can change the frequencies of traits, phyletic microevolution of traits within species and phylogenetic trait evolution among species, the tempo and mode of microevolution can also change trait frequencies. Species selection, phylogenetic, and phyletic processes can all contribute to large-scale trends, reinforcing or canceling each other out. Even more complex interactions among macroevolutionary processes are possible when multiple covarying traits are involved. Here I present a multilevel macroevolutionary framework that is useful for understanding how macroevolutionary processes interact. It is useful for empirical studies using fossils, molecular phylogenies, or both. I illustrate the framework with the macroevolution of coloniality and photosymbiosis in scleractinian corals using a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny. I find that standing phylogenetic variation in coloniality and photosymbiosis deflects the direction of macroevolution from the vector of species selection. Variation in these traits constrains species selection and results in a 200 million year macroevolutionary equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

After an initial period of dissociation, a 200 million year phase of coupled change and stability is observed. A microevolutionary link between coloniality and photosymbiosis constrains the response to species selection for coloniality and non-photosymbiosis.&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Equatorial decline of reef corals during the last Pleistocene interglacial</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kiessling, W., Simpson, C., Beck, B., Mewis, H. &amp;amp; Pandolfi, J. 2012. Equatorial decline of reef corals during the last Pleistocene interglacial. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;. 109(52): 21378-21383. doi:10.1073/pnas.1214037110 &lt;a href=&quot;/papers/Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2012 Kiessling.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Last Interglacial (LIG; ca. 125,000 y ago) resulted from rapid global warming and reached global mean temperatures exceeding those of today. The LIG thus offers the opportunity to study how life may respond to future global warming. Using global occurrence databases and applying sampling-standardization, we compared reef coral diversity and distributions between the LIG and modern. Latitudinal diversity patterns are characterized by a tropical plateau today but were characterized by a pronounced equatorial trough during the LIG. This trough is governed by substantial range shifts away from the equator. Range shifts affected both leading and trailing edges of species range limits and were much more pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere than south of the equator. We argue that interglacial warming was responsible for the loss of equatorial diversity. Hemispheric differences in insolation during the LIG may explain the asymmetrical response. The equatorial retractions are surprisingly strong given that only small temperature changes have been reported in the LIG tropics. Our results suggest that the poleward range expansions of reef corals occurring with intensified global warming today may soon be followed by equatorial range retractions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Add a timescale in base R graphics</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;timescales-on-figures-are-helpful&quot;&gt;Timescales on figures are helpful&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good idea to add geological timescales to plots that show patterns over the Phanerozic. Timescales help the reader orient themselves with the new and interesting data that we want to show them. They can see more detail and with this orientation it is also easier for them to critically evaluate the pattern in the plot. Having a timescale on a plot is a win for the reader and it is a win for the author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to add a timescale to a figure. Some are minimal, with the timescale flowing along the bottom as an addendum to the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;-axis that serves only to link an interval name to a time in millions of years. Other ways of adding a timescale take up more space in the figure. The timescale can flow behind the data making it easy to see when a pattern takes place. The most maximal approaches take the color scheme and all the subdivisions from the official timescale and add all of that information to the figure. This maximilist approach has a unique color for every stage. The rainbow of timescale colors duplicates in color the information that is contained in the space along the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;-axis. For example, the timing of a data point at the end of the Cretasious will be shown in the color of the timescale and in the position along the horizontal axis. A colored timescale also limits the choice we have of using colors to show different aspects of data without accedentially using a color that also indicates a specific time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any figure, the data is the most important aspect. We make a figure to show a pattern in the data. A timescale should add to the interpratability of the data and the pattern that we are showing. The timescale shouldn’t get in the way, obscure, or take prominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features that I have found to be most affective in adding context to data without getting in the way are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An un-filled ribbon with coarse-scale geological period or epoch names that run parallel to the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;x&lt;/script&gt;-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A backdrop of alternating light-grey values that show intervals that are the same level as the ribbon or one step finer in resolution. It is important that the backdrop is much coaser than the scale that we plot the data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve fiddled with these details in the figures I’ve made and published. Over time, I’ve settled on a basic set starting rules for creating the backdrop and ribbon. I’ve life to start with a stage-level backdrop and a ribbon showing epochs when plotting data that is restricted to the Cenozoic or other single Period. If the figure shows a pattern that is Phanerozoic-scale or more, then the backdrop and the ribbon are no finer than period-level. In between these extremes, if my plot spans multiple periods, but less than the whole Phanerozoic, then my backdrop shows epochs and the ribbon shows the periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the purpose of the figure itself suggests a different style of timescale. I want to make it easy to try all of these possabilities out and find the best solution for  each figure. For this purpose, I’ve written some functions that add timescales to R plots. This makes it easy to add in and swap different timescales easily. I’ve made functions for base plots that are added to figures after the plot is defined but before the data are plotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grey backdrop serves to make tone down the timescale and to highlight the data. But it is important to chose the level of greys and the difference between them carefully.Too much difference between alternating greys can make segments of a single color look different as it passes across the backdrop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/knitr-figs/fig1-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk fig1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See how the blue line shifts color as it crosses from dark to light grey bars? This effect should be minimized as much as possible because it is addes noise to a figure. As our figures become more complicated, this noise will start to get in the way and make it difficult to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greys are too disimilar in the plot above. If we keep the grey bars close in value we can mimimize the appearent color chnage of out data. So that the similarity helps to keep the colors we use to plot data easily comparable across time. Through experimentation I’ve settled on a set of greys that work well, at least as a starting point. The difference between &lt;code&gt;grey90&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;grey95&lt;/code&gt; remain slight enough to minimize the apperent color changes as our data spans the timescale, but they are also visually distinct enough to keep the timescale legible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/knitr-figs/fig2-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk fig2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this backdrop is too light, the specific greys can be changed. But in my experience, an interval of 5 between greys works best. So as the backdrop can is darkerned keep the greys 5 units apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-basic-time-series&quot;&gt;A basic time series&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these examples, I’ll plot time series of extinction rates. These examples are patterns of extinction for marine invertebrates over the Phanerozoic, including splits for physiologically buffered and unbuffered taxa (from Kiessling and Simpson 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to this time series &lt;a href=&quot;/data/ext.csv&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;, a link to the timescale &lt;a href=&quot;/R/timescale.functions.R&quot;&gt;functions&lt;/a&gt;, and links to &lt;a href=&quot;/data/periods.csv&quot;&gt;period&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/data/epochs.csv&quot;&gt;epoch&lt;/a&gt; interval ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;ext &amp;lt;- read.csv(&quot;~/Dropbox/projects/Rmarkdown/timescales/ext.csv&quot;, header = T)

plot(ext$$Age.Ma, ext$$q, type = &quot;l&quot;, xlim = c(550, 0), xlab = &quot;Age (Ma)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Extinction rate&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/knitr-figs/basicfig-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk basicfig&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bare-bones figure. With the functions below, we will add timescales to these basic figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;some-functions-and-examples&quot;&gt;Some functions and examples&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s load a fucntion that draws a timescale with a ribbon and backdrop demarking the periods over the Phanerozoic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;tscales.period &amp;lt;- function(top, bot, s.bot, ...) {
    bases &amp;lt;- read.csv(&quot;~/Dropbox/projects/Rmarkdown//timescales/periods.csv&quot;, 
        header = T)
    cc &amp;lt;- rep(c(&quot;grey95&quot;, &quot;grey97 &quot;), length(bases))
    
    rect(xleft = bases[-12, 2], ybottom = rep(bot, 11), xright = bases[-1, 2], 
        ytop = rep(top, 11), col = cc, border = NA)
    
    rect(xleft = bases[-12, 2], ybottom = rep(bot, 11), xright = bases[-1, 2], 
        ytop = rep(s.bot, 11), border = &quot;grey90&quot;)
    
    bt &amp;lt;- (bot + s.bot)/2
    tpl &amp;lt;- bases[, 2] + c(diff(bases[, 2])/2, 0)
    
    text(x = tpl[-12], y = bt[-12], labels = bases[1:11, 1])
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we just append a plot command with this function you’ll get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;plot(ext$$Age.Ma, ext$$q, type = &quot;l&quot;, xlim = c(550, 0), xlab = &quot;Age (Ma)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Extinction rate&quot;)

tscales.period(1.4, 0, -0.1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/knitr-figs/tscale1-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk tscale1&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Which is not very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I like to define a plot region with some extra space for the ribbon and also without drawing anything. Then I add in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the timescale&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the axes and axis labels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;plot(ext$$Age.Ma, ext$$q, type = &#39;n&#39;, 
       xlim = c(550,0), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.5),
       axes = F, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)

tscales.period(1.5, 0, -0.1)

 lines(ext$$Age.Ma, ext$$q, lwd = 2)

axis(1, col = &#39;grey75&#39;, line = -0.5)
axis(2, col = &#39;grey75&#39;, line = -2, at = seq(0, 1.5, 0.25))

mtext(&quot;Age (Ma)&quot;, side = 1, line = 1.5)
mtext(&quot;Extinction rate&quot;, side = 2, line = 1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/knitr-figs/tscale.all-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk tscale.all&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a few tweeks of s.bot and the bottom limit of ylim to line things up right. I also like to adjust the axis position and specify the tick marks at this time. This figure is nice and clean, with the pattern highlighted and quietly supported by the timescale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a timescale function with the backdrop showing epochs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;tscales.epoch &amp;lt;- function(top, bot, s.bot){
  labels &amp;lt;- read.csv(&quot;~/Dropbox/projects/Rmarkdown//timescales/periods.csv&quot;, header = T)
  bases &amp;lt;- as.vector(read.csv(&quot;~/Dropbox/projects/Rmarkdown/timescales/epochs.csv&quot;, header = T))
  end &amp;lt;- dim(bases)[1]
  cc &amp;lt;- rep(c(&quot;grey95&quot;,&quot;grey97 &quot;),length(bases))

  rect(xleft = bases[-end,], ybottom = rep(bot, end), xright = bases[-1,],
       ytop = rep(top, end), col = cc, border=NA)

  rect(xleft = labels[-12, 2], ybottom = rep(bot,11), xright = labels[-1, 2],
       ytop = rep(s.bot, 11), border = &#39;grey90&#39;)
  
  bt &amp;lt;- (bot+s.bot)/2
  tpl &amp;lt;- labels[,2]+c(diff(labels[,2])/2,0)

  text(x=tpl[-12], y=bt[-12], labels = labels[1:11, 1])
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;plot(ext$$Age.Ma, ext$$q, type = &#39;n&#39;, 
       xlim = c(550,0), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.5),
       axes = F, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)

tscales.epoch(1.5, 0,  -0.1)

lines(ext$$Age.Ma, ext$$q, lwd = 2)

axis(1, col = &#39;grey75&#39;, line = -0.5)
axis(2, col = &#39;grey75&#39;, line = -2, at = seq(0, 1.5, 0.25))

mtext(&quot;Age (Ma)&quot;, side = 1, line = 1.5)
mtext(&quot;Extinction rate&quot;, side = 2, line = 1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/knitr-figs/tscale.epoch-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;plot of chunk tscale.epoch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this scale it is a bit noisy. So let’s zoom in on this time series, and make a few scaling adjustments to keep the ribbon just larger than the text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;plot(ext$$Age.Ma, ext$$q, type = &#39;n&#39;, 
       xlim = c(250,0), ylim = c(-0.1, 0.7),
       axes = F, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)

tscales.epoch(0.7, 0, -0.05)

At this scale, an epoch-level backdrop works well. We can use it to orient ourselves within each period but it does not distract us from the patterns we want to show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with two time series (both plotted in grey with labels), this backdrop does not get busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;plot(ext$$Age.Ma, ext$$q, type = &#39;n&#39;,

&lt;p&gt;For this particular figure, I think it would help to change the aspect ratio so that the peaks in extinction are not so towering. This way we can see more clearly those times when boffered and unbuffered genera differ in their extinction rates. The goal with time series is to have an aspect ratio that tends to make the average slope at most 45 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot;&gt;par(tcl = -0.2, mgp = c(0,0.5,0))

&lt;p&gt;Shallow slopes on a time series will help us see patterns in the data more clearly (Cleveland, McGill, and McGill 1988; Tufte 2006; Talbot, Gerth, and Hanrahan 2012). In this example we can see that buffered and unbuffered genera diverge in extinction patterns during mass extincitons. When acidification is high, the unbuffered genera (those that can’t physiologically isolate themselves from the background ocean ph) suffer more extinction than buffered genera. Interestingly at the K-Pg extinction buffered genera have higher extinction rates. With the data plotted this way, we can see all the important events, see how they differ from each other and from the background, and see this all without relying on extra statistical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wide and short figure even works for a longer time series.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Long-term differences in extinction risk among the seven forms of rarity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Harnik, P. G., Simpson, C., &amp;amp; Payne, J. L. 2012. Long-term differences in extinction risk among the seven forms of rarity. &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society B - Biological Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. doi:10.1098/rspb.2012.1902 &lt;a href=&quot;/papers/Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences 2012 Harnik.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarity is widely used to predict the vulnerability of species to extinction. Species can be rare in markedly different ways, but the relative impacts of these different forms of rarity on extinction risk are poorly known and cannot be determined through observations of species that are not yet extinct. The fossil record provides a valuable archive with which we can directly determine which aspects of rarity lead to the greatest risk. Previous palaeontological analyses confirm that rarity is associated with extinction risk, but the relative contributions of different types of rarity to extinction risk remain unknown because their impacts have never been examined simultaneously. Here, we analyse a global database of fossil marine animals spanning the past 500 million years, examining differential extinction with respect to multiple rarity types within each geological stage. We observe systematic differences in extinction risk over time among marine genera classified according to their rarity. Geographic range played a primary role in determining extinction, and habitat breadth a secondary role, whereas local abundance had little effect. These results suggest that current reductions in geographic range size will lead to pronounced increases in long-term extinction risk even if local populations are relatively large at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;six columns&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The relative odds of extinction for the seven forms of rarity over the last 500 million years, with risk increasing from the bottom to top panels. Data are from figure 1, and are the number of time intervals characterized by different odds of extinction for genera in each rarity class relative to common genera. The solid black lines denote equal odds of extinction between rare and common genera. Dashed white lines denote the median relative odds of extinction for each rarity class over the last 500 million years. At the greatest risk of extinction are genera with both small ranges and narrow habitat breadth. Broader habitat breadth helps buffer narrowly distributed genera from extinction, whereas variation in the population size has negligible effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Extinctions in ancient and modern seas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Harnik, P. G., Lotze, H., Anderson, S. C., Finkel, Z. V. Finnegan, S., Lindberg, D. L., Liow, L. H., Lockwood, R., McClain, C. M., McGuire, J. L., O’Dea, A., Pandolfi, J. M., Simpson, C., Tittensor, D. 2012. Extinctions in ancient and modern seas. &lt;em&gt;Trends in Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;. 27(11) 608-617. doi://10.1016/j.tree.2012.07.010 &lt;a href=&quot;/papers/Trends Ecol. Evol. 2012 Harnik.pdf&quot;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming century, life in the ocean will be confronted with a suite of environmental conditions that have no analog in human history. Thus, there is an urgent need to determine which marine species will adapt and which will go extinct. Here, we review the growing literature on marine extinctions and extinction risk in the fossil, historical, and modern records to compare the patterns, drivers, and biological correlates of marine extinctions at different times in the past. Characterized by markedly different environmental states, some past periods share common features with predicted future scenarios. We highlight how the different records can be integrated to better understand and predict the impact of current and projected future environmental changes on extinction risk in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt; Evidence of marine extinctions in the fossil and historical records. (a) Extinction rate of all marine genera in the Phanerozoic [past 550 million years (Ma)] and (b) by major clades in the Cenozoic (past 65 Ma); horizontal gray lines and corresponding numerical values in (b) are the mean Cenozoic extinction rates. (c) Cumulative number of global extinctions of marine species in historical times (1500–2000 AD). Fossil data are from the Paleobiology Database (http://paleodb.org). Abbreviation: Bp, before present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
